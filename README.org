* SB-THREAD-SHIM for arm32
  sbcl does not have thread support on armhf, but some software which doesn't
  really need threads assumes it will always be present & calls
  ~SB-THREAD:MAKE-THREAD~ when ~CL:FUNCALL~ would work. this shim does just
  that, so i can use [[https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm][stumpwm]] on armhf (to take advantage of the optimization of
  using a 32-bit abi on a machine with <= 4gb ram).
